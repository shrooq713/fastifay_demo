# Fastify_demo

## Introduction

Fastify_demo is a demonstration project showcasing the capabilities and features of Fastify, a web framework highly focused on providing the best developer experience with the least overhead and a powerful plugin architecture.


## Get Started

To get started with Fastify, follow these steps:

**Initialize npm project**:

    ```
    npm init
    ```

**Install fastify**:

    ```
    npm i -s fastify
    ```
## What is ESM?

ESM stands for ECMAScript Modules. It's a feature in JavaScript that allows you to use native modules without the need for a module bundler like CommonJS (Node.js) or RequireJS (browser). Fastify has support for ESM, meaning you can use ECMAScript Modules directly in your Fastify application.

When you're using ESM in Fastify, you can import modules using the `import` statement instead of `require`.

**If you are using ECMAScript Modules (ESM) in your project, be sure to include**:

    ```
    {
    "type": "module"
    }
    ```

**Install fastify**:

    `
    npm run start
    `
